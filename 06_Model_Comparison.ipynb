    "\n",
    "- The **Gradient Boosting Classifier** achieved the strongest overall performance, with the best accuracy (0.92), F1-score (0.93), and perfect recall (1.0), while also achieving the highest ROC AUC (0.888).  \n",
    "- The **SVM with RBF kernel** was a close second, showing stable and well-balanced results with a strong ROC AUC (0.874).  \n",
    "- The **Decision Tree** reached perfect recall but had the weakest ROC AUC, indicating poor discrimination overall.  \n",
    "- The **Random Forest** improved recall but lagged behind Gradient Boosting in precision and overall balance.  \n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** provided a reasonable baseline but underperformed compared to tree-based methods and SVM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, **Gradient Boosting** is selected as the best-performing model for this dataset, followed closely by **SVM (RBF kernel)**.  \n"
